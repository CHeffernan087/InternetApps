## Hello World Lab

This lab asked us to make use of promises in a static html/js context. To complete this lab a student was required to implement a decrementing counter using the `setTimeout()` inside of a promise. The purpose of the lab was to become more acquainted with promises. The approach which I took was to define a recursive function which would wait for a promise to resolve before calling itself recursively with a decremented value.

My solution for the lab is primarily defined in `index.js`, all the other files are either other parts of the tutorial or just to improve the aesthethic of the final product and are relatively unimportant.

To run simply download and open `index.html` or view the page running [here](http://robot-271.getforge.io/)
